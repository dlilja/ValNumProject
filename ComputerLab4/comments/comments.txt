The solution to exercise 1 uses the Krawczyk method with automatic
differentiation to find all the zeros.

The solution to exercise 3 uses the fact that a normal distribution can be
interpreted as the function erf(x) multiplied by appropriate constants. The
given parameters a and b thus correspond to values of x for which the corrected
erf(x) equals 0.95 and 0.99 respectively. Subtracting these values the problem
becomes one of finding zeros of the created function and the values a and b can
thus be found by using the Krawczyk method from before.
